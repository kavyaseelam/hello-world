# About ME

My name is Kavyasree Seelam and I'm a second year Computer Science student. I intend to use GitHub to explore new languages and go beyond my coursework. My goal at the moment is to develop better skills in C++, HTML, and SQL. Going forward, I want to be able to build a website from scratch and also try a hand at app development.
